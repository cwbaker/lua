# Lua

This is a copy of official Lua 5.3.4 with support added for building using [Sweet Build](https://github.com/cwbaker/sweet_build).

Changes are made in the *sweet-build* branch (the default branch for this fork).  These changes will be rebased onto the *master* branch when updating to newer Lua versions.
